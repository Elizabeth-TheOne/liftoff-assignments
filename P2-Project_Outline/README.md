## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here
My super awesome project is for teachers, tutors, or anyone interested in being organized 
in an academic setting.  It is tentatively titled “Grade Book”.  The teacher will have the ability
to add students to a grade book, add subjects, add a grade and access an API. Excellent 
way to stay organized.  The idea sprang out of my original idea of widgets and whatnots.

### Features
Include Features here
o	Display: be able to update and display added information.
o	List: each student will have display of subjects and grades.
o	Database: store the information and make calls to it.

### What I'll Have to Learn
Include what you will need to learn here
I want to add a public API to my project, I think it will add an interesting element to 
the project.  As I drill further into my project there will probably be issues on how the
technologies can be linked or work together.  Building a project from the ground up is 
an excellent way to refresh skills and learn something new. It’s an exciting journey!
